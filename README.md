# Simon_game
A traditional game called Simon game or Genius.

This simple program was important to fix some concepts, such as: 
 * JavaScript:
    * Math.floor() and Math.random() that are so relevant;
    * If statement;
    * setTimeOut() that is used frequently;
    * JQuery features(fadein(), fadeOut(), text(),addClass,removeClass;
    * Arrays;
    * boolean;
 * HTML:
    * basic features, but essential;
 * CSS:
    * using tags, classes and id's, hover, e other significant properties;
    
    
 Therefore, it was fun to code and be able to add so many interesting features. :)âœ¨
